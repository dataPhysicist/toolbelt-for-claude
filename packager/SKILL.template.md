# {{AGENT}}

{{DESC}}

This skill is a thin router. {{AGENT}}'s actual instructions, skills, knowledge, and
memory live in Toolbelt and are always fetched live — never rely on this file for them.

> **Tool-name convention used throughout this file:** tool names below are written with the
> `{{PREFIX}}` prefix (the form the `.mcpb` install uses). When {{AGENT}} is connected via the
> **gateway URL** instead, the SAME tools appear **without** that prefix, grouped under the
> "{{AGENT}}" connector (e.g. `load_persona` rather than `{{PREFIX}}load_persona`). Treat every
> `{{PREFIX}}`-prefixed name below as "with or without the prefix, whichever is present."

## Getting started (first run — no {{AGENT}} tools available)

This skill routes to the {{AGENT}} **connector**. If no tools tagged "[{{AGENT}}]"
exist in this chat, the connector isn't installed or enabled yet. Welcome the user warmly
as {{AGENT}}'s setup guide and walk them through the one-time connect (don't dump all
steps as a wall — guide them). There are two ways; **lead with Option A** — it's the
fewest steps and needs no file and no key typed into chat.

### Option A — Connect by URL (recommended)

1. **Add the connector.** Claude → **Settings → Connectors → Add connector** (or the
   "+" → **Add connector** in a chat). Paste this exact URL:

   `https://toolbelt-oauth-gateway.onrender.com/workspaces/{{WORKSPACE_ID}}/mcp`

2. **Sign in.** Claude opens the {{AGENT}} sign-in page. Paste your Toolbelt API key once
   (Toolbelt → **Settings → Connect to Claude**) and submit. The key is sealed on the
   gateway — it never touches Claude, and there's no workspace ID to look up (it's in the
   URL). This also works on **claude.ai web**.
3. **Start a new chat** (connectors attach when a conversation starts), confirm "{{AGENT}}"
   is toggled ON in the "+" → Connectors menu, and ask your question again.

### Option B — Install the desktop connector file (.mcpb)

Use this if the user prefers the key in their OS keychain (Bearer header, no gateway) or
is offline from the gateway.

1. **Give them the installer — the CORRECT one.** Use ONLY `{{SLUG}}.mcpb` located in
   **this skill's own base directory** (the exact path shown when this skill loads).
   **Do NOT search the user's project folder, repo, or filesystem for a `.mcpb`** — other
   copies may be old builds and will install a broken/outdated connector. Surface the
   base-directory file directly (in Cowork, present it with the file-presentation tool for
   a clickable card). Only if that file is genuinely missing, fall back to the download
   link: https://github.com/dataPhysicist/toolbelt-for-claude/raw/main/dist/{{SLUG}}.mcpb (always current). The connector version is shown on
   its install page and in its first tool ("★ … connector vX") — confirm it matches the
   latest if unsure.
2. **Install it:** double-click the file (Claude → Settings → Extensions → Install
   Extension also works). When prompted, enter their Toolbelt **API key**
   (Toolbelt → Settings → Connect to Claude; stored in the OS keychain) and their
   **{{AGENT}} workspace ID** (`{{WORKSPACE_ID}}`, also in the Toolbelt dashboard URL).
3. **Start a new chat** (connectors attach when a conversation starts) and make sure
   "{{AGENT}}" is toggled ON in the chat's "+" → Connectors menu. Then ask the same
   question again.

If a `{{PREFIX}}toolbelt_setup` tool appears instead of the agent's tools, the connector is
installed but missing its key — ask for the API key and call `{{PREFIX}}toolbelt_setup` with it.

## How to reach {{AGENT}} (check in this order — do NOT skip to delegation)

"Use {{AGENT}}" means: become {{AGENT}} and use its tools directly. It does NOT
mean hand the task to a sub-agent. Resolve access in this order:

> **Tool names depend on how {{AGENT}} is connected — match EITHER form:**
> • **Gateway URL connector (recommended):** tools are **unprefixed** and grouped under the
>   "{{AGENT}}" connector — e.g. `load_persona`, `get_calendar`, `wrench_execute`.
> • **`.mcpb` install:** the same tools are **prefixed** with the agent's initials —
>   `{{PREFIX}}load_persona`, `{{PREFIX}}get_calendar`, `{{PREFIX}}wrench_execute`.
> Below, `load_persona` means "the load_persona tool in whichever form is present." If a
> request is in {{AGENT}}'s lane and a `load_persona`/`{{PREFIX}}load_persona` tool exists in
> this chat, that IS {{AGENT}} — route to it; don't ask the user which connector to use.

1. **Direct tools (the normal case in Claude Desktop/Cowork).** If {{AGENT}}'s tools are
   present in EITHER form above — a `load_persona` (or `{{PREFIX}}load_persona`) tool exists —
   USE THEM DIRECTLY. Call `load_persona` first to adopt the operating instructions, then
   do the work with the agent's own tools. This is the primary path — never reach for
   `manage_delegations` when these tools exist.
2. **No such tools yet?** They may be a moment from loading — try once more / a new
   message. If a generic `manage_delegations` IS available (a Toolbelt-native session) and
   {{AGENT}}'s tools are not, then delegate to assistant id `{{WORKSPACE_ID}}` via
   `manage_delegations`.
3. **Neither available?** The {{AGENT}} connector isn't loaded for this chat. Tell
   the user to enable "{{AGENT}}" in the "+" → Connectors menu (or install it), and
   stop — don't silently substitute yourself.

Once you have the agent (path 1 or 2):

- BEFORE real work, call `load_persona` (`{{PREFIX}}load_persona`) and fully adopt the
  returned instructions (several agents share services like calendar/email — what differs
  is their context).
- Prefer the agent's own tools: the `wrench_*` tools are its skills;
  `read_storage_file` / `list_storage_files` / `grep_storage_file` (or the `{{PREFIX}}`
  forms) are its files and memory.
- Answer in the agent's voice and cite what you used.

## Delegating to OTHER MODELS (sub-chats / Model Auto-Pilot)

This is a DIFFERENT thing from reaching {{AGENT}} above. Use it only when the user
wants the work run on a specific or different model provider (e.g. "use gpt-5.4-mini",
"compare answers across providers"). Toolbelt runs sub-chats on MANY providers — OpenAI,
Gemini, Anthropic, and free Crescent models. For ordinary requests, just use the
`{{PREFIX}}*` tools directly (above) — do not wrap them in a sub-chat.

**Trust Toolbelt's model catalog over your own knowledge.** Model names like
`gpt-5.4-mini`, `gemini-3.5-flash`, `claude-opus-4-8`, or `crescent-medium` may be
newer than your training data — they are real. NEVER tell the user a model doesn't exist;
if unsure, check the agent's `ModelAutoPilot.md` storage file (`{{PREFIX}}read_storage_file`)
for the current catalog and routing rules.

How to delegate (the reliable pattern):

1. Create: `{{PREFIX}}toolbelt` with action `create_sub_chat` and params JSON:
   `{"targetAssistantId": "<this agent's workspace id>", "content": "<the task>", "provider": "<openai|gemini|anthropic>", "model": "<model>"}`.
   Infer provider from the model family (gpt-* → openai, gemini-* → gemini, claude-* → anthropic).
   It returns a correlationId immediately.
2. Wait: `{{PREFIX}}toolbelt` action `sleep` with `{"timeoutSeconds": 30, "wakeOnAnyComplete": true}`.
   A `timeout` wake is NOT failure — the sub-chat is still working. Sleep again
   (several rounds for heavy tasks). When `wokeReason` is `sub_chat_complete`, the
   answer is in `subChats[].lastMessage` — use it directly.
3. If the user names a model, pass it through verbatim. If not, pick per MAP: cheap/fast
   (gemini-3.5-flash, gpt-5.4-mini) for routine work; claude-opus-4-8 for
   must-be-correct work; when unsure, round UP.

## Org policy & approvals (set by IT/Security in Toolbelt)

Tool permissions are governed server-side in Toolbelt (owner/org/workspace levels). A tool
set to **"ask"** is NOT executed on the first call — Toolbelt returns an
**APPROVAL REQUIRED** result with a Confirmation ID. When you see that:

1. STOP. The action has not happened. Tell the user plainly what the action would do.
2. Ask the user to approve. **Never approve on their behalf.**
3. ONLY if the user explicitly approves, call the same tool again with the same arguments
   plus `__confirmationId` set to the Confirmation ID. If they decline, do not proceed.

A tool set to **"deny"** cannot be run — explain that org policy blocks it.

## Working with the agent's storage (interop contract)

The agent's storage is the durable "brain" — treat it with care (full contract:
`Skills/ClientInterop.md` in the agent's storage):

- **Read `INDEX.md` first** (`{{PREFIX}}read_storage_file`) instead of listing or reading
  all of storage.
- **Save chat assets only when the user asks** ("save this to Toolbelt"): write to
  `Inbox/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<filename>` — text via `{{PREFIX}}write_text_file`, images/binary via
  `{{PREFIX}}upload_file_to_storage` (base64) — and append one line to `Inbox/MANIFEST.md`
  (date | filename | source | sha256-12 | description). Never write outside `Inbox/`
  except the agent's own Memory logs.
- **Scope stays `assistant`** unless the user explicitly asks to share org-wide.
- Expect the agent to answer with short summaries + storage handles rather than full
  documents; ask for the full text explicitly when you need it.

## Staying in sync with Toolbelt
