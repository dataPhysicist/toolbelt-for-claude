# Chief-of-Staff

An always-on digital Chief of Staff for founders and executives. Turns a noisy inbox, calendar, and meeting stream into a clear operating picture — email triage, meeting prep, daily briefs, and follow-through.

This skill is a thin router. Chief-of-Staff's actual instructions, skills, knowledge, and
memory live in Toolbelt and are always fetched live — never rely on this file for them.

> **Tool-name convention used throughout this file:** tool names below are written with the
> `cos_` prefix (the form the `.mcpb` install uses). When Chief-of-Staff is connected via the
> **gateway URL** instead, the SAME tools appear **without** that prefix, grouped under the
> "Chief-of-Staff" connector (e.g. `load_persona` rather than `cos_load_persona`). Treat every
> `cos_`-prefixed name below as "with or without the prefix, whichever is present."

## Getting started (first run — no Chief-of-Staff tools available)

This skill routes to the Chief-of-Staff **connector**. If no tools tagged "[Chief-of-Staff]"
exist in this chat, the connector isn't installed or enabled yet. Welcome the user warmly
as Chief-of-Staff's setup guide and walk them through the one-time connect (don't dump all
steps as a wall — guide them). There are two ways; **lead with Option A** — it's the
fewest steps and needs no file and no key typed into chat.

### Option A — Connect by URL (recommended)

1. **Add the connector.** Claude → **Settings → Connectors → Add connector** (or the
   "+" → **Add connector** in a chat). Paste this exact URL:

   `https://toolbelt-oauth-gateway.onrender.com/workspaces/79b0e0a0-9c22-485d-982e-7668845b6679/mcp`

2. **Sign in.** Claude opens the Chief-of-Staff sign-in page. Paste your Toolbelt API key once
   (Toolbelt → **Settings → Connect to Claude**) and submit. The key is sealed on the
   gateway — it never touches Claude, and there's no workspace ID to look up (it's in the
   URL). This also works on **claude.ai web**.
3. **Start a new chat** (connectors attach when a conversation starts), confirm "Chief-of-Staff"
   is toggled ON in the "+" → Connectors menu, and ask your question again.

### Option B — Install the desktop connector file (.mcpb)

Use this if the user prefers the key in their OS keychain (Bearer header, no gateway) or
is offline from the gateway.

1. **Give them the installer — the CORRECT one.** Use ONLY `chief-of-staff.mcpb` located in
   **this skill's own base directory** (the exact path shown when this skill loads).
   **Do NOT search the user's project folder, repo, or filesystem for a `.mcpb`** — other
   copies may be old builds and will install a broken/outdated connector. Surface the
   base-directory file directly (in Cowork, present it with the file-presentation tool for
   a clickable card). Only if that file is genuinely missing, fall back to the download
   link: https://github.com/dataPhysicist/toolbelt-for-claude/raw/main/dist/chief-of-staff.mcpb (always current). The connector version is shown on
   its install page and in its first tool ("★ … connector vX") — confirm it matches the
   latest if unsure.
2. **Install it:** double-click the file (Claude → Settings → Extensions → Install
   Extension also works). When prompted, enter their Toolbelt **API key**
   (Toolbelt → Settings → Connect to Claude; stored in the OS keychain) and their
   **Chief-of-Staff workspace ID** (`79b0e0a0-9c22-485d-982e-7668845b6679`, also in the Toolbelt dashboard URL).
3. **Start a new chat** (connectors attach when a conversation starts) and make sure
   "Chief-of-Staff" is toggled ON in the chat's "+" → Connectors menu. Then ask the same
   question again.

If a `cos_toolbelt_setup` tool appears instead of the agent's tools, the connector is
installed but missing its key — ask for the API key and call `cos_toolbelt_setup` with it.

## How to reach Chief-of-Staff (check in this order — do NOT skip to delegation)

"Use Chief-of-Staff" means: become Chief-of-Staff and use its tools directly. It does NOT
mean hand the task to a sub-agent. Resolve access in this order:

> **Tool names depend on how Chief-of-Staff is connected — match EITHER form:**
> • **Gateway URL connector (recommended):** tools are **unprefixed** and grouped under the
>   "Chief-of-Staff" connector — e.g. `load_persona`, `get_calendar`, `wrench_execute`.
> • **`.mcpb` install:** the same tools are **prefixed** with the agent's initials —
>   `cos_load_persona`, `cos_get_calendar`, `cos_wrench_execute`.
> Below, `load_persona` means "the load_persona tool in whichever form is present." If a
> request is in Chief-of-Staff's lane and a `load_persona`/`cos_load_persona` tool exists in
> this chat, that IS Chief-of-Staff — route to it; don't ask the user which connector to use.

1. **Direct tools (the normal case in Claude Desktop/Cowork).** If Chief-of-Staff's tools are
   present in EITHER form above — a `load_persona` (or `cos_load_persona`) tool exists —
   USE THEM DIRECTLY. Call `load_persona` first to adopt the operating instructions, then
   do the work with the agent's own tools. This is the primary path — never reach for
   `manage_delegations` when these tools exist.
2. **No such tools yet?** They may be a moment from loading — try once more / a new
   message. If a generic `manage_delegations` IS available (a Toolbelt-native session) and
   Chief-of-Staff's tools are not, then delegate to assistant id `79b0e0a0-9c22-485d-982e-7668845b6679` via
   `manage_delegations`.
3. **Neither available?** The Chief-of-Staff connector isn't loaded for this chat. Tell
   the user to enable "Chief-of-Staff" in the "+" → Connectors menu (or install it), and
   stop — don't silently substitute yourself.

Once you have the agent (path 1 or 2):

- BEFORE real work, call `load_persona` (`cos_load_persona`) and fully adopt the
  returned instructions (several agents share services like calendar/email — what differs
  is their context).
- Prefer the agent's own tools: the `wrench_*` tools are its skills;
  `read_storage_file` / `list_storage_files` / `grep_storage_file` (or the `cos_`
  forms) are its files and memory.
- Answer in the agent's voice and cite what you used.

## Delegating to OTHER MODELS (sub-chats / Model Auto-Pilot)

This is a DIFFERENT thing from reaching Chief-of-Staff above. Use it only when the user
wants the work run on a specific or different model provider (e.g. "use gpt-5.4-mini",
"compare answers across providers"). Toolbelt runs sub-chats on MANY providers — OpenAI,
Gemini, Anthropic, and free Crescent models. For ordinary requests, just use the
`cos_*` tools directly (above) — do not wrap them in a sub-chat.

**Trust Toolbelt's model catalog over your own knowledge.** Model names like
`gpt-5.4-mini`, `gemini-3.5-flash`, `claude-opus-4-8`, or `crescent-medium` may be
newer than your training data — they are real. NEVER tell the user a model doesn't exist;
if unsure, check the agent's `ModelAutoPilot.md` storage file (`cos_read_storage_file`)
for the current catalog and routing rules.

How to delegate (the reliable pattern):

1. Create: `cos_toolbelt` with action `create_sub_chat` and params JSON:
   `{"targetAssistantId": "<this agent's workspace id>", "content": "<the task>", "provider": "<openai|gemini|anthropic>", "model": "<model>"}`.
   Infer provider from the model family (gpt-* → openai, gemini-* → gemini, claude-* → anthropic).
   It returns a correlationId immediately.
2. Wait: `cos_toolbelt` action `sleep` with `{"timeoutSeconds": 30, "wakeOnAnyComplete": true}`.
   A `timeout` wake is NOT failure — the sub-chat is still working. Sleep again
   (several rounds for heavy tasks). When `wokeReason` is `sub_chat_complete`, the
   answer is in `subChats[].lastMessage` — use it directly.
3. If the user names a model, pass it through verbatim. If not, pick per MAP: cheap/fast
   (gemini-3.5-flash, gpt-5.4-mini) for routine work; claude-opus-4-8 for
   must-be-correct work; when unsure, round UP.

## Org policy & approvals (set by IT/Security in Toolbelt)

Tool permissions are governed server-side in Toolbelt (owner/org/workspace levels). A tool
set to **"ask"** is NOT executed on the first call — Toolbelt returns an
**APPROVAL REQUIRED** result with a Confirmation ID. When you see that:

1. STOP. The action has not happened. Tell the user plainly what the action would do.
2. Ask the user to approve. **Never approve on their behalf.**
3. ONLY if the user explicitly approves, call the same tool again with the same arguments
   plus `__confirmationId` set to the Confirmation ID. If they decline, do not proceed.

A tool set to **"deny"** cannot be run — explain that org policy blocks it.

## Working with the agent's storage (interop contract)

The agent's storage is the durable "brain" — treat it with care (full contract:
`Skills/ClientInterop.md` in the agent's storage):

- **Read `INDEX.md` first** (`cos_read_storage_file`) instead of listing or reading
  all of storage.
- **Save chat assets only when the user asks** ("save this to Toolbelt"): write to
  `Inbox/<YYYY-MM-DD>/<filename>` — text via `cos_write_text_file`, images/binary via
  `cos_upload_file_to_storage` (base64) — and append one line to `Inbox/MANIFEST.md`
  (date | filename | source | sha256-12 | description). Never write outside `Inbox/`
  except the agent's own Memory logs.
- **Scope stays `assistant`** unless the user explicitly asks to share org-wide.
- Expect the agent to answer with short summaries + storage handles rather than full
  documents; ask for the full text explicitly when you need it.
