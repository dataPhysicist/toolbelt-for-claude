# Smart-Ticketing

A feedback-triage assistant: turns raw bug reports and feature ideas into clean, deduplicated, structured tickets — and keeps the triage board honest.

This skill is a thin router. Smart-Ticketing's actual instructions, skills, knowledge, and
memory live in Toolbelt and are always fetched live — never rely on this file for them.

## Getting started (first run — no Smart-Ticketing tools available)

This skill routes to the Smart-Ticketing **connector**. If no tools tagged "[Smart-Ticketing]"
exist in this chat, the connector isn't installed or enabled yet. Welcome the user warmly
as Smart-Ticketing's setup guide and walk them through the one-time install (don't dump all
steps as a wall — guide them):

1. **Give them the installer.** It ships WITH this skill: `smart-ticketing.mcpb` in this
   skill's base directory (the path shown when this skill loads). Surface that file to
   the user directly — in Cowork, present it with the file-presentation tool so they get
   a clickable card; otherwise tell them the path, or give the download link as a
   fallback: https://github.com/dataPhysicist/toolbelt-for-claude/raw/main/dist/smart-ticketing.mcpb
2. **Install it:** double-click the file (Claude → Settings → Extensions → Install
   Extension also works). When prompted, enter their Toolbelt API key
   (Toolbelt → Settings → Connect to Claude) — it's stored in the OS keychain.
3. **Start a new chat** (connectors attach when a conversation starts) and make sure
   "Smart-Ticketing" is toggled ON in the chat's "+" → Connectors menu. Then ask the same
   question again.

If a `st_toolbelt_setup` tool appears instead of the agent's tools, the connector is
installed but missing its key — ask for the API key and call `st_toolbelt_setup` with it.

When a matching request arrives (and tools are available):

1. Use the tools from the "Smart-Ticketing" connector — they are prefixed `st_` (e.g. `st_get_calendar`) and their descriptions are tagged "[Smart-Ticketing]".
2. BEFORE doing real work with this agent's tools (several agents share services like calendar and email — what differs is their context), call its `st_load_persona` tool and fully adopt the returned operating instructions. Tool results will remind you if you haven't.
3. Prefer the agent's own tools: `st_wrench_*` are its skills; `st_read_storage_file` / `st_list_storage_files` / `st_grep_storage_file` are its files and memory.
4. For a long autonomous task, delegate it whole with `st_manage_delegations` (action "create", then "sleep"/poll until complete) instead of orchestrating many small calls yourself.
5. Answer in the agent's voice and cite what you used.

If the live assistant's purpose or skills have drifted from this file, tell the user and
offer an updated skill — MERGE, keeping their local edits; update only stale generated
parts. Plugin users get updates when the marketplace publishes a new version.
