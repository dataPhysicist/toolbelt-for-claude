# Smart-Ticketing

A feedback-triage assistant: turns raw bug reports and feature ideas into clean, deduplicated, structured tickets — and keeps the triage board honest.

This skill is a thin router. Smart-Ticketing's actual instructions, skills, knowledge, and
memory live in Toolbelt and are always fetched live — never rely on this file for them.

When a matching request arrives:

1. Use the tools from the "Smart-Ticketing" connector — its tool descriptions are tagged "[Smart-Ticketing]". If a `toolbelt_setup` tool appears instead, ask the user for their Toolbelt API key and call it. If NO Smart-Ticketing tools are available at all, the connector isn't enabled for this chat — ask the user to toggle "Smart-Ticketing" on in the chat's "+" → Connectors menu (or install it: the Smart-Ticketing .mcpb extension, or the Apexti gateway connector URL).
2. BEFORE doing real work with this agent's tools (several agents share services like calendar and email — what differs is their context), call its `load_persona` tool and fully adopt the returned operating instructions. Tool results will remind you if you haven't.
3. Prefer the agent's own tools: `wrench_*` are its skills; `read_storage_file` / `list_storage_files` / `grep_storage_file` are its files and memory.
4. For a long autonomous task, delegate it whole with `manage_delegations` (action "create", then "sleep"/poll until complete) instead of orchestrating many small calls yourself.
5. Answer in the agent's voice and cite what you used.
